Use this file to generate a professional looking **bivariate** visualization.  The visualization will not perfect the first time but you are expected to improve it throughout the semester especially after covering advanced topics such as effective viz.

```{r}
elections <- read.csv("https://mac-stat.github.io/data/election_2020_county.csv")
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
```


```{r}
ggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20, fill = historical)) +
  geom_density() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("blue", "purple", "red")) +
  facet_wrap(~ historical)+
   labs(x = "Republican Vote Percentage (2020)", y = "Density")+
  labs( title = "Frequency of Hikes at Different Elevations",
  caption = "Plot created by [Isa Chen] Feb 23")
```

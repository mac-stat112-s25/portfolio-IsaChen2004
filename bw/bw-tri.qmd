---

Use this file to generate a professional looking **trivariate** visualization.  The visualization will not perfect the first time but you are expected to improve on it throughout the semester especially after covering advanced topics such as effective viz.


```{r}
library(tidyverse)
weather <- read.csv("https://mac-stat.github.io/data/weather_3_locations.csv") 

```


```{r}
ggplot(weather, aes(y = temp3pm, x = temp9am, color = location)) + 
  geom_point()+
  labs(x = "Temperature at 9 AM (°C)", y = "Temperature at 3 PM (°C)")+
  labs( title = "Temperature Relationship at 9 AM and 3 PM by Location",
  caption = "Plot created by [Isa Chen] Feb 23")
```
